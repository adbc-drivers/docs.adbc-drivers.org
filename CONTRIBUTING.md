# How to Contribute

## Reporting Issues

Please file issues on the GitHub issue tracker:
https://github.com/adbc-drivers/docs.adbc-drivers.org/issues

> [!TIP]
>
> The markdown pages under the `./drivers` folder are generated automatically
> during the release process for each driver and then synchronized into this
> repo after drivers are released. If you report an issue with the documentation
> for a driver, a maintainer may redirect or duplicate your issue to the
> repository for the driver.

Potential security vulnerabilities should be reported to
[security@adbc-drivers.org](mailto:security@adbc-drivers.org) instead.  See
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/docs.adbc-drivers.org?tab=security-ov-file#readme).

## Opening a Pull Request

Before opening a pull request:

- Review your changes and make sure no stray files, etc. are included.
- Ensure the Apache license header is at the top of all files.
- Check if there is an existing issue.  If not, please file one, unless the
  change is trivial.
- Assign the issue to yourself by commenting just the word `take`.
- Run the static checks by installing [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/),
  then running `pre-commit run --all-files` from inside the repository.  Make
  sure all your changes are staged/committed (unstaged changes will be
  ignored).

When writing the pull request description:

- Ensure the title follows [Conventional
  Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.  The
  component should be `docs` if it affects the content of any pages, or it can
  be omitted for general maintenance. Example
  titles:
  - `docs: add new page for xyz`
  - `chore: update action versions`
  - `chore: update sphinx version`

- Make sure the bottom of the description has `Closes #NNN`, `Fixes #NNN`, or
  similar, so that the issue will be linked to your pull request.

## Setting up a Developer Environment

We use [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) for managing the development process. See [Pixi Installation](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/) for information on how to install Pixi.

Once Pixi is installed, run:

```sh
pixi run
```

to see the available tasks.
