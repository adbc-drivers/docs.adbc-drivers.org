# Building Drivers

:::{warning}
**This guide is a work-in-progress.**
:::

In ADBC's first years, only a handful of drivers existed. Most were built by a small group of core developers within the Apache Arrow project, and a few by independent community members. Then ADBC went mainstream, and demand for new drivers exploded. At the same time, the vendors behind the databases, query engines, and data platforms that ADBC connects to wanted an active role in the direction and maintenance of their own drivers. The centralized Apache Software Foundation governance model was ill-suited to both: it funneled every contribution through the small group of core maintainers who could review and merge it, and it gave vendors no real ownership of the drivers that carried their names.

The ADBC Driver Foundry ("the Foundry") was created to fix this. Each driver lives in its own repository, with its own maintainers and commit privileges. Those who own a driver can steer its direction and ship changes without waiting on a central gatekeeper. But the Foundry stops short of the opposite extreme—fully independent projects, each reinventing the basics and drifting toward its own conventions. Instead, it pairs that autonomy with shared scaffolding. Common frameworks and consistent processes hold every driver to the same baseline of functionality and polish. Centrally run services handle the work each driver would otherwise duplicate—validating drivers; building binaries; code-signing, notarizing, and distributing them; and documentation. For driver developers, this means time spent on the driver itself, not on the machinery of shipping it. For users, it means one trustworthy place to find drivers, and a consistent experience across them—rather than the fragmented, uneven landscape typical of earlier driver ecosystems.

This model has proven successful. The Foundry is now home to more than a dozen drivers from a diverse group of vendors, and it has emerged as the preferred source of drivers for numerous downstream systems that rely on ADBC for database connectivity. And there's much further to go: the infrastructure behind the Foundry is built to handle hundreds more drivers as the ecosystem continues to grow.

Concretely, the Foundry provides:

- A home for your drivers in our [adbc-drivers](https://github.com/adbc-drivers) GitHub organization
- Well-tested and feature complete SDKs for building drivers in a variety of languages
- Ready to run CI workflows for building, testing, and releasing drivers on all major platforms
- A flexible and extensible driver validation suite to help you test and document your drivers capabilities
- A place to host documentation for your driver (this website)

If you're interested in building a driver with the Foundry, continue reading to understand the process. If you have any questions, we encourage you to join the [Columnar Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/columnar-community/shared_invite/zt-3gt5cb69i-KRjJj~mjUZv5doVmpcVa4w) or to file an issue at [adbc-drivers/onboarding](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/onboarding).

## Repository Modes

Your code can live in a repo in the [adbc-drivers](https://github.com/adbc-drivers) organization or under your GitHub organization.

**Internal**: If you choose to develop under [adbc-drivers](https://github.com/adbc-drivers), a Foundry administrator can grant your team members enough permission to operate entirely independently, including managing secrets and environments for access to external cloud resources.

**External:** If you prefer to develop your driver under your own organization, a Foundry administrator can create a build-only repository for your driver under adbc-drivers.

## Process

At a high level, here's what the process looks like to go from zero to a fully released and dbc-installable driver.

1. File an issue at [adbc-drivers/onboarding](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/onboarding). Fill in the template describing the driver you want to build or contribute.
2. A Foundry administrator creates a repo for your driver in the adbc-drivers organization.
3. A Foundry administrator adds templates with common workflows, CI, and validation.
4. They invite members of your team and give you appropriate access.
5. You develop the driver as you see fit.
6. You tag releases as they are ready.

When you tag a release, you can coordinate with Foundry administrators to make it available on distribution channels like [dbc](https://columnar.tech/dbc).

## Resources

The Foundry offers a variety of tools to help develop and maintain drivers.

### SDKs

The Foundry is focused on building drivers as shared libraries that can be loaded by any ADBC Driver Manager. Under this mode, drivers can be written in any language that can export a C ABI.

In practice, most drivers are written in C/C++, Go, or Rust. And because Go and Rust are such common choices, the Foundry provides frameworks for both languages that include helpers for common concerns such as error handling and managing result sets, testing, and more. Both of these projects use a "HEAD-only" model where formal releases are not made: just depend on the latest commit. (Also, we currently do not publish these helper frameworks to package managers like crates.io, though that may change in the future.)

#### Go

[driverbase-go](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/driverbase-go)

Components:

- driverbase: a framework for building drivers
- ffitemplate: a template that generates the necessary FFI glue code
- testutil: helpers for writing unit tests
- validation: a Go-specific common test suite that can also be used to test the driver

#### Rust

[driverbase-rs](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/driverbase-rs/)

Components:

- driverbase: a framework for building drivers

### Internal Tooling/Templating

The Foundry maintains a set of scripts that are used to build, test, and release the drivers. We ask that your driver include these scripts, even if you do not make use of them yourself, as they prepare artifacts in the right format and help us amortize maintenance across all the drivers. (For example, they build Linux drivers in a container to ensure they don't depend on too new of a glibc.)

These scripts are all invoked through [pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/). We also maintain a tool in [adbc-drivers/dev](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/dev) that templates out common GitHub Actions workflows and the pixi config itself, so that you do not have to update this yourself. It can be run as follows (using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

```shell
# from the repo root
uvx \
  --from git+https://github.com/adbc-drivers/dev \
  adbc-gen-workflow generate $(pwd)
```

Based on the configuration file in `.github/workflows/generate.toml`, it will generate CI workflows (see below) and a pixi config. We provide a [JSON schema for the configuration file](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/dev/blob/main/schema/generate-schema.json), and the tool will generate a minimal config if it is run from a repository without a config file. See below for more information about how to use the tool.

#### pre-commit

The Foundry maintains [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to validate license headers (see below), which we suggest you use. Also, we encourage the use of pre-commit for things like formatting code.

### Testing

We encourage you to test your driver thoroughly. In particular, we encourage you to use the validation suite (described next), but unit tests and other integration tests you develop yourself may also be added.

### Validation & Conformance Testing

The Foundry provides a validation suite at [adbc-drivers/validation](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/validation) that tests common driver functionality and generates user documentation based on the results. These tests are independent of the driver's implementation.

Specifically, the validation suite is a [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) test suite designed to be overridden and customized for your particular driver. It loads the driver shared library, tests different driver features like the metadata catalog, and runs a series of queries and bulk ingest operations. The test suite records the results and asserts that the expected Arrow data types, result data, etc. are received. This tests both feature completeness and correctness. The results are used to generate documentation showing users supported features and how the driver maps your database's column types to Arrow data types and vice versa.

If you use the standard CI pipelines described below, then this suite will be run for each PR and release, and the generated documentation will be included in the release artifacts. We the Foundry administrators ask that you run this suite so that we can include the documentation on [docs.adbc-drivers.org](https://docs.adbc-drivers.org).

#### Bootstrapping

Currently, we do not have a tool to template this out. We encourage you (or your agent) to look at existing examples.

Examples for data systems that run in the cloud:

- [BigQuery](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/bigquery/tree/main/go/validation)
- [Snowflake](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/snowflake/tree/main/go/validation)

Examples for data systems that run locally and can be dockerized for testing:

- [MySQL](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/mysql/tree/main/go/validation)
- [Trino](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/trino/tree/main/go/validation)

In addition to the tests themselves, a documentation skeleton must be added at `docs/<drivername>.md`. For example, see the template for [BigQuery](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/bigquery/blob/main/go/docs/bigquery.md). This skeleton will be filled in with the result of the tests. The documentation is written in [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) and will be rendered with the [Sphinx documentation system](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), so you can use the full power of Sphinx directives in addition to basic Markdown.

#### Customizing Tests

The main customization point is your implementation of the `DriverQuirks` class, which defines which features are supported (and hence tested).

The queries run by the validation suite can be overridden. See the [documentation](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/validation#adding-new-tests) on the expected format.

Individual tests can be overridden by subclassing/overriding the base test classes. It is not recommended to do this unless necessary as it creates more maintenance work when the tests change or are updated.

#### Running Validation

The pixi config (discussed above) already has dependencies on pytest and the validation suite and can be used to run the tests:

```shell
pixi run validate
```

This wraps pytest's CLI and accepts the same arguments:

```shell
# Run only ingest tests
pixi run validate -k 'ingest'

# Run only GetObjects tests
pixi run validate -k 'get_objects'
```

This will generate a `validation-report.xml` file. The documentation can then be generated:

```shell
pixi run gendocs --output generated/
```

It is recommended to generate the documentation from a full run of the test suite; the generator may not handle partial test results properly in all cases.

### Benchmarks & Performance Testing

We are working on infrastructure for benchmarking. Please talk to us if you would like to learn more.

### CI, Build, and Release

As described {ref}`above <building-drivers-internal-tooling>`, we maintain tools that template out common GitHub Actions workflows and generate packages for release. While maintaining your own CI is of course an option, we recommend at least using the generated workflows as a base.

The basic config will look like this:

```toml
driver = "mysql"

[lang.go]
```

This expects the driver to be located in the `go/` subdirectory. You can configure it to expect the driver at the root instead:

```toml
driver = "mysql"

[lang.go]
subdir = "."
```

See the [JSON schema for the configuration
file](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/dev/blob/main/schema/generate-schema.json) for more details about what can be customized.

If your driver is located in another repo or you wish to use C/C++, you will need custom code. You can see an example of this in the [Quack driver](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/quack), which defines `ci/scripts/build.sh` and `ci/scripts/test.sh` to wire up the C++ build system to the CI workflows.

If you include a `compose.yaml`, you can run tests/validation against a container. There are also various other hooks like `pre-test.sh` and `pre-build.sh` to do any other customization that may be needed.

### Licensing

Generally, drivers are open source under a permissive license. We suggest (and use) [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), not least because many of us come from a background as maintainers of or contributors to Apache Software Foundation projects, but other permissive open source licenses like MIT or BSD are also reasonable. Please ensure that your driver does not depend on proprietary or copyleft components (i.e. that the driver actually fulfills the requirements of a permissive license). If you use the {ref}`standard CI workflows <building-drivers-internal-tooling>` and build your driver in Rust, this will be enforced for you by [cargo-about](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/).

If you would like to distribute a binary-only driver, or a driver that has binary-only dependencies, please talk with us.

For Apache-licensed repositories:

- Put a LICENSE.txt at the root.
- Put a NOTICE.txt at the root.
- All files (within reason) should have the Apache license header and copyright declaration:

  ```text
  Copyright (c) 2026 ADBC Drivers Contributors

  [...]
  ```

- Files that were originally migrated from an Apache Software Foundation repository should keep the original header with this prefix on top:

  ```text
  Copyright (c) 2026 ADBC Drivers Contributors

  This file has been modified from its original version, which is
  under the Apache License:
  ```

- Use our pre-commit hook (see above), which will check this:

  ```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/adbc-drivers/dev
    rev: <insert latest revision>
    hooks:
    - id: rat
  ```

  The pre-commit hook can be configured with `.rat-excludes` and `.rat-apache` files at the root. The former lists (glob) patterns of files to ignore; the latter maintains an allowlist of files that are expected and allowed to have the "This file has been modified from its original version…" text.

### Distribution & Packaging

If you use the {ref}`standard CI workflows <building-drivers-internal-tooling>`, then pushing a tag will trigger a build-test-release that ends with a new release on GitHub containing packages that we can then upload to the CDN. Otherwise, you will need to generate appropriate packages yourself; you can see the [packaging script](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/dev/blob/main/adbc_drivers_dev/package.py) as a reference for the format. You will also need to generate a `manifest.toml` and ideally a documentation page (again, all of this is handled by the standard CI workflows).

Once you have a GitHub release with the expected formats, let a Foundry administrator know so we can check the release and upload it to the dbc CDN.

### Repository Standards

We ask that all open source repositories follow these standards:

- Ensure the Licensing guidelines above are followed.
- Put a `README.md` at the root answering these questions. You are encouraged to follow the format and style of an existing README.
  - What is it?
  - How do I install it? Instructions inline.
  - How do I use it / learn more about it? Some mix of inline and linking to docs is fine.
  - How do I build it? Inline or link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - How do I contribute (link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Put a `CONTRIBUTING.md` at the root with this information. You are encouraged to follow the format and style of an existing `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - Reporting bugs
  - Reporting security vulnerabilities
    - Point to the **Security Policy** using the URL `https://github.com/adbc-drivers/<repo>?tab=security-ov-file#readme`
  - Making feature requests
  - Setting up a developer environment
  - Development: Cover any git standards (e.g., conventional commits), code style, etc.
  - Point to the **Code of Conduct** using the URL `https://github.com/adbc-drivers/<repo>?tab=coc-ov-file#readme`
- Do **not** add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` or `SECURITY.md` at root (they are provided globally by the .github repo).
- Name the default branch `main`.
- Add a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
  - Add language-specific linters.
    - For Go, configure `golangci-lint` and `.golangci.toml` (best to copy the configuration from an existing repository) as well as a local hook for `go fix`.
    - For Rust, configure `cargo fmt`.
- Update the GitHub landing page. On the top right of the repository page, under the gear icon:
  - Fill in "About".
  - Add topics for the repository.
  - Hide the packages and deployments sections.
- Update the GitHub settings.
  - Disable Wikis.
  - Disable Projects.
  - Enable "Always suggest updating pull request branches".
  - Enable "Automatically delete head branches".
  - Disable non-squash merging.
  - Set squash merging to "Pull request title and description".
- Ensure Dependabot is configured.
- Add issue templates and pull request template, if desired.

After making a repository public:

- Enable approvers in environments.
- In Settings > Actions, check that "Approval for running fork pull request workflows from contributors" is set to "Require approval for all external contributors" (this should be the default).

## FAQ

### Why not under apache/arrow-adbc?

[apache/arrow-adbc](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc) is under the Apache Software Foundation, and the maintenance is shared with the broader Apache Arrow project. That creates problems for driver developers and for the Arrow maintainers. For contributors focusing on particular drivers, granting them privileges for their particular projects is difficult or impossible, and the road to maintainership requires demonstrating contributions to the Arrow project as a whole. And for the Arrow maintainers, reviewing contributions and releasing drivers adds to the already large workload of a relatively small group. The Foundry solves this mismatch between the centralized privilege model of Apache projects and the federated nature of driver development.

### Who owns the repo under adbc-drivers?

The author of the driver is the primary owner of the repository and has administrator privileges over it. The ADBC Driver Foundry is a co-owner that helps manage the repository and provides the hosting.

### When is a driver ready for release?

There is no hard requirement for a driver to be "ready", but generally:

- It should support Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- It should support a minimum baseline of functionality: querying, bulk ingest, and basic metadata operations (GetObjects).
- It should run the standard validation suite and ensure the minimum functionality passes.

Drivers that do not quite meet these requirements but want to make an initial release for testing can make a prerelease by tagging with an appropriate version number (e.g. `v0.1.0-alpha.1`).

### After I build my driver, how does it become available with dbc?

[TODO](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/docs.adbc-drivers.org/issues/97)

### Who is responsible for releasing?

[TODO](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/docs.adbc-drivers.org/issues/97)

### Who is responsible for responding to issues?

[TODO](https://github.com/adbc-drivers/docs.adbc-drivers.org/issues/97)

### What's the best language for writing drivers?

As long as you can produce a shared library on Linux/macOS/Windows that implements the ADBC C APIs, then any language works in principle. We have found that Go and Rust are most convenient, due to the tooling we've built around them. C/C++ also works, but setting up the build has been more trouble. In theory, C#/.NET would also work, but we currently do not distribute any drivers based on this toolchain.
